##clear_willmsg

```javascript

**Return value**

*Number*: Error code

**Example**

See [full example](#full-example)

##tls_set

```javascript
Number tls_set(String ca_file, String ca_path, String cert_file, String key_file)
```

**Description**

Configure the client for certificate based SSL/TLS support.
Must be called before [connect](#connect).

**Parameters**

 - *String*: ca_file path to a file containing the PEM encoded trusted CA certificate files.
   	     Either cafile or capath must not be NULL.
 - *String*: ca_path path to a directory containing the PEM encoded trusted CA certificate files.
 - *String*: cert_file path to a file containing the PEM encoded certificate file for this client.
   	     If NULL, keyfile must also be NULL and no client certificate will be used.
 - *String*: key_file path to a file containing the PEM encoded private key for this client.
   	     If NULL, certfile must also be NULL and no client certificate will be used.

##tls_insecure_set

```javascript
Number tls_insecure_set(Boolean insecure)
```

**Description**

Configure verification of the server host name in the server certificate.
If value is set to true, it is impossible to guarantee that the host
you are connecting to is not impersonating your server.
This can be useful in initial server testing, but makes it possible
for a malicious third party to impersonate your server through DNS spoofing, for example.
Do not use this function in a real system. Setting value to true makes
the connection encryption pointless. Must be called before [connect](#connect).

**Parameters**

 - *Boolean*: insecure if set to false, the default, certificate host name		checking is performed. If set to true, no host name checking
   	      is performed and the connection is insecure.

**Return value**

*Number*: Error code

**Example**

See [full example](#full-example)

##tls_opts_set

```javascript
Number tls_opts_set(String cert_reqs, String version, String ciphers)
```

**Description**

Configure the client for certificate based SSL/TLS support.
Must be called before [connect](#connect).

**Parameters**

 - *String*: cert_reqs an integer defining the verification requirements
   	     the client will impose on the server. This can be one of:
	     	 	SSL_VERIFY_NONE (0): the server will not be verified in any way.
			SSL_VERIFY_PEER (1): the server certificate will be verified
					     and the connection aborted if the verification fails.
	     The default and recommended value is SSL_VERIFY_PEER.
	     Using SSL_VERIFY_NONE provides no security.
 - *String*: version the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use as a string.
   	     If NULL, the default value is used.
	     The default value and the available values depend on the
	     version of openssl that the library was compiled against.
	     For openssl >= 1.0.1, the available options are tlsv1.2,
	     tlsv1.1 and tlsv1, with tlv1.2 as the default.
	     For openssl < 1.0.1, only tlsv1 is available.
 - *String*: ciphers a string describing the ciphers available for use.
   	     See the "openssl ciphers" tool for more information.
	     If NULL, the default ciphers will be used.

**Return value**

*Number*: Error code

**Example**

See [full example](#full-example)

##tls_psk_set

```javascript
Number tls_psk_set(String key, String identity, String ciphers)
```

**Description**

Must be called before [connect](#connect). Cannot be used in conjunction
with [tls_set](#tls_set).

**Parameters**

 - *String*: key the pre-shared-key in hex format with no leading "0x".
 - *String*: identity the identity of this client. May be used as the
   	     username depending on the server settings.
 - *String*: ciphers a string describing the ciphers available for use.
   	     See the "openssl ciphers" tool for more information.
	     If NULL, the default ciphers will be used.

**Return value**

*Number*: Error code

**Example**

See [full example](#full-example)
